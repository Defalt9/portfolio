  <h1>TraeThinkful</h1>
  <p>Software Engineer</p> 

  <h2>Greetings</h2>
  <p>I am currently a student at Thinkful. I have always been fascinated with the fine detail and strict nature that coding entails. My coding journey will mold me into a fine developer. My goal is to develop my knowledge of technology so that I may pursue my career as a :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Front End Developer </li>
    <li>Back End Developer</li>
    <li>Full Stack Developer</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>Currently residing in the DFW area. The food is as great as texas and the people are a <i>'hoot' </i>for some good <em>'hollerin'!</em></p>

  <h2>My Journey</h2>
 
  <p>Since the training started I have fully embraced the resources provided for me. Sleep have become a daily battle in the early rooster mornings and late creaking nights. However, the desire and will to keep trudging along keeps me standing firm in my decision. Watch out! theres a new devloper round these here parts</p>
 
  <p>When I'm not busy learning code, I like:</p>
  <ul><li>Song Writing</li>
      <li>Exercising</li>
  </ul>
